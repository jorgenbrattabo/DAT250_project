git.From last time, I managed somehow to make the poll work again. I think the problem was that i did not do npm run build and copy the files after editing the files, but I am not 100% sure. 

For this task I have mostly looked up the errors, which came when i ran polltest and looked in the index.html report, and fixed these until there were none left. I got stuck some times and had to use some time to fix the problems, but mostly it has just been looking at problems and fixing each one as they came along.  

Tried to use the h2-console, but did not get past the log in page. Says it can't find the database. Couldn't find out how i can do this. 

I don't get what you mean by "a link to your code for experiment 2". But at least all the test passes!

Since i did not manage to inspect the database with h2-console, i don't have any screenshots unfortunately. Wanted to get help on this in the laboratory this week, but guess I have to wait until next week.
