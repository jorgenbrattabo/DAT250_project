Main problem has been that i don't have any experience with java and react, so this was quite hard for me. It does currently not work the way i want it to, especially the voiting part, but now i have used so much time on this that I am going to deliver what i have and get help during the week to find out what the problem is. 

Had problems with getting the actual poll up on webpage after you created the poll after combining frontend with the backend. Ended up adding a pollresponse inner class inside pollcontroller and making some changes in pollcontroller.java.

Also, while i can get into the webpage i get error message when making a poll, and it does not work to vote on the webpage. Don't know why this happens.

In general, this has been very hard for me.
